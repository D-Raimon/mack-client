# Mack Client
### Frontend

Mack is a manga tracking app that was built with the idea of keeping track of 
reading materials from multiple websites all in one convenient place. While the 
idea started out with manga this could also be utilized for light novels, comics, 
web toons, and many other forms of media that are consumed from multiple websites.

Users can sign up, sign in, change their password, and sign out. On sign in a user
can check out all of their current stories or add a new story that they just started
reading. Users can also update various information regarding their stories such as the
current chapter or they can also delete a story if they are no longer reading it.
